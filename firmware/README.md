# Firmware
This board uses the same firmware as the original project by lvd. It has been copied here for convenience, but it is unmodified.

The firmware was originally developed for Altera EPM7032SLC44 CPLDs, these use the .POF file. You can flash it with `quartus_pgm` and one of the cheap USB Blaster programmer clones you can find everywhere.

Atmel/Microchip makes compatible devices under the ATF1502 series, so the ATF1502AS-10JC44 can be used as an alternative, which is easier to find nowadays (-10J*U*44 is fine as well). It can be programmed with the .JED file using the [ATDH1150USB](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATDH1150USB) programmer.

## Flashing the firmware
Before installing the board into your Amiga, you will need to flash the firmware to the CPLD chip.

If you read the above, you will know that these days you will only find the ATF1502AS-10JC44 (or -10JU44) on the market, but you will need to use a >50â‚¬ programmer (only once!) to program it, which doesn't sound reasonable. Besides, all the tools mentioned above are Windows-only so if you are a Linux user like me, you're pretty screwed. Luckily, there is a solution that allows flashing the Atmel chip with the cheap USB Blaster clones. I have developed and tested it under Linux, but it should also work on Windows and OS X.

*NOTE: One user recommended to get a full size Altera USB Blaster cable clone, not the cheaper USB 'Mini' Blaster clone, as he could not get the latter to work with the ATF1502AS. Either the Mini programmer does not support this chip or has some issues with the software we use, but switching to the full size Blaster cable RevC solved this issue.*

First of all you need to power the board. JTAG programmers are not supposed to provide power, hence you need to do so separately. The board does not have a dedicated power connector, but you can use the pads of C1 (which I don't recommend installing, unless you have stability issues) or pins 2 (GND) and 4 (VCC) of the IDC connector. The board needs 5V, I usually take those from an Arduino board but feel free to use whatever suits you.

On the software side, you will need [UrJTAG](http://urjtag.sourceforge.net). I have only tested version 2018.09, others might work or not. I am not sure this version is readily available in binary format, so you might have to compile it.

You will also need to get the [BSDL (Boundary Scan Description Language) files for the 1502 CPLDs](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/programmable-logic/spld-cpld/tools/software/BSDL). Download the zip file, uncompress it anywhere you like and take note of the path, you will need it later.

Finally, you will need the firmware in SVF format, available in this folder. Use either `4mb.svf` or `8mb.svf` according to how you assembled your board.

Now you are ready for the actual flashing, so connect your USB Blaster to the IDC connector on the board and plug it into an USB port on your PC. Then run urjtag as follows:

```
sukko@shockwave firmware $ sudo jtag

jtag> cable UsbBlaster
Connected to libftdi driver.
```

This means that your USB Blaster was detected correctly. Let's load the BSDL files, this is where you will need to use the path you took note of at the beginning:
```
jtag> bsdl <path>
jtag>
```

Now we can scan the JTAG chain:
```
jtag> detect
IR length: 10
Chain length: 1
Device Id: 00000001010100000010000000111111 (0x0150203F)
  Manufacturer: Atmel (0x03F)
  Part(0):      ATF1502ASV (0x1502)
  Stepping:     A
  Filename:     /usr/share/urjtag/atmel/atf15xx/atf1502as
```

This means that the CPLD was found and it is ready to be programmed. If you get no output at this step, try disconnecting and reconnecting the USB Blaster or power to the board. Then start the flashing:
```
jtag> svf 8mb.svf progress stop
warning: unimplemented mode 'ABSENT' for TRST
detail: Parsing   3660/3668 ( 99%)detail:
detail: Scanned device output matched expected TDO values.
```

If you get the above output, the flashing was successful and you can start using your board. If instead you get something like:
```
jtag> svf 8mb.svf
warning: unimplemented mode 'ABSENT' for TRST
Error svf: mismatch at position 64 for TDO
 in input file between line 2196 col 1 and line 2198 col 32
```

Then there was an error during the flashing, check your wiring, power and try again.


## Tinkering with the firmware
The firmware was developed with Quartus 7.2, somewhat totally old and outdated, but I never got any problems with it. I DO NOT recommend using Quartus 6.x as I caught it generating wrong designs (in a way, nothing is working and when you swap to Quartus 7.2 not touching you project, everything is working back).

If you want to move to something newer, it seems that Quartus 10.x and 11.x are still supporting EPM7000S chips. Starting from Quartus 12.x there's no more support for that devices.

### POF => JED
Quartus will produce a .POF file. This can be converted to a .JED file for Atmel devices through [Microchip's POF2JED utility](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/programmable-logic/spld-cpld/tools/software/pof2jed), which is Windows-only unfortunately.

### JED => SVF
An SVF file can be produced using [Microchip's ATMISP tool](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/programmable-logic/spld-cpld/tools/software/atmisp), which is also Windows-only.


*Thanks a lot to lvd for providing most of the above information and helping me come up with the Linux flashing procedure.*
*Also thanks to majinga and go0se for testing and helping improve this procedure.*
